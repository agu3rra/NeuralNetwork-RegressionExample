# NeuralNetwork-RegressionExample
iPython notebook based on tutorial from http://machinelearningmastery.com/regression-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library-python/

This is the Notebook file I've created when followin the tutorial available in the above link. At the end of the file, I've added a prediction based on new data and the comments available on the same link.
Hopefully this can be of help to anyone reading this. :)
