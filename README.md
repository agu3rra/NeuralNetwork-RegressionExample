# NeuralNetwork-RegressionExample
iPython notebook based on tutorial from http://machinelearningmastery.com/regression-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library-python/

## What this is:
An implementation of Python code for training a Neural Network to solve a regression problem. In this scenario, we're using a subset of the famous Boston House Prices to train a model and predict new house price values.

The notebook available here was created by following the tutorial available in the above link. At the end of the code, I've added a prediction based on new data and the comments available on the same link.
Hopefully this can be of help to anyone reading this. :)

## Libraries in use:
- Sklearn
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pandas
